I seem to have trouble regarding String and StringBuilder manipulation.
Since I learned all the basic concepts in C++, I'm having a hard time understanding it in Java.
I'll try to practice more and get used to it.

I've been practicing String and StringBuilder manipulation.
I'm starting to get the hang of it.
I'll search for the documentation and try to understand it more.
Specially String manipulation.
