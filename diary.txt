I seem to have trouble regarding String and StringBuilder manipulation.
Since I learned all the basic concepts in C++, I'm having a hard time understanding it in Java.
I'll try to practice more and get used to it.

I've been practicing String and StringBuilder manipulation.
I'm starting to get the hang of it.
----- 
I made some flashcards in order to remember the most important methods and concepts.
They're available in my README.md archive.
I'll keep practicing and try to solve more problems.

Today I learned about in-place algorithms.
I needed to search for some YouTube videos to understand it better.
It is actually okay to understand, but rather confusing to visualize.
