I took a break from studying and went to see my parents in the countryside.

I'm back to studying and today I learned about Factorial Trailing Zeroes.
I first did a Fibonacci by accident, but it was a good practice.
-----
Using XOR is a good way to save memory and time.
However, it is confusing to understand at first.

I recently moved to another city, so I temporarily stopped solving leeetcode problems.
I applied to some positions: a monitorship in statistics, a scholarship in Swift language, and a confidential position.
I hope to not lose my focus on my studies.

I'm back to studying and today I learned about Add Binary.
However, the code ended being a MESS, and I needed to look on the Solution tab.
I'll try to understand it better and solve it by myself.
-----
I also learned about Character commands.
They can be really useful to deal with standartization of Strings.

Today I learned about Systen.gc() and how to use it to clean the memory.
All of the top performing answers used this command at the end before returning the result.
I went from beating 30% of the answers to 95% of them.
Such an interesting command.

Today I took an interview for an monitorship in statistics.
I wonder what is gonna happen.

<<13/08/2024>> 0040, 0234, 2073, 1137

Today I relearned about Backtracking.
I needed to look on the Solution tab, but I understood the code.
-----
Also relearned Linked Lists. 
Honestly, this problem was pretty easy. I could solve 100% by myself.
-----
Took some time to solve an Queue problem.
Pretty easy.
