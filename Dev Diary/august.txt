I took a break from studying and went to see my parents in the countryside.
It was a great time to relax and enjoy the fresh air.
I took some time offline, love them so much <3

I'm back to studying and today I learned about Factorial Trailing Zeroes.
I first did a Fibonacci by accident, but it was a good practice.

I'm starting to get used to Java and the LeetCode platform.
