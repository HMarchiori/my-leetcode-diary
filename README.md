# Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the Algorithms Practice repository! Here you'll find solutions to various programming problems that I've solved, organized in a way to facilitate study and review. This repository is a great way to showcase problem-solving skills and code development for recruiters.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **`/problems`**: Contains subfolders for each specific problem, including problem descriptions, solutions, and test cases.
  - **`/problem1`**: Example problem.
    - `README.md`: Problem description and solution.
    - `solution.java`: Code for the solution.
    - `testcases.txt`: Test cases to validate the solution.

- **`/solutions`**: Contains different solutions for problems, if applicable.
  - **`/two-sum`**: Examples of alternative solutions for the Two Sum problem.
    - `solution-v1.java`: First solution.
    - `solution-v2.java`: Second solution.

- **`/docs`**: Additional documentation, such as detailed explanations and diagrams.
  - `explanation-of-techniques.md`: Explanations of techniques and concepts used.

- **`/tests`**: Test files and related data.
  - `plus-one-testcases.txt`: Test cases for the Plus One problem.

## How to Contribute

If you want to add new problems or improve existing solutions, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your contributions. Please follow the existing organization pattern.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired problem.
2. Compile the code with the command: `javac solution.java`.
3. Execute the code with the command: `java Solution`.

Make sure all test cases have been verified to ensure the solution is correct.
