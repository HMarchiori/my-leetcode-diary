# Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the Algorithms Practice repository! Here you'll find solutions to various programming problems that I've solved, organized by topic to facilitate study and review. This repository is designed to track my progress over time. Details about each problem and my ideas can be found in the comments within the archive.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topic as follows:

- **Arrays and Strings**: Problems related to arrays and strings.
- **Linked Lists**: Problems related to linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Problems related to stacks and queues.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Problems related to trees and graphs.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Problems related to sorting and searching algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems related to dynamic programming.
- **Math and Logic**: Problems related to math and logic.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Problems related to object-oriented design.
- **Recursion and Backtracking**: Problems related to recursion and backtracking.

All of the problems are solved using Java, and the solutions are stored in an .txt file. The file name is the same as the problem name, and the solution is stored in a class named Solution. The class contains the main method, which is used to test the solution.
